"I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie ""Lion King"" or the first ""Toy Story"" did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.6.9/10",neutral
This is an alright animated film by Disney for all viewers to watch and enjoy. I found the storyline to be a bit straightforward but good to watch. I did not fully enjoy this animated film by Disney. The cast selection was great. They really connected to their respective characters.This Disney animated film reveals to viewers the importance of locations. It is real important to experience everything that the world has to offer in life. The people who are in my life try to hold me back from experiencing unknown places of the world. Locations of the world also carry knowledge for everyone. This is an alright animated film by Disney for everyone to watch and enjoy.,neutral
"I don't hate this movie but it's not as perfect as everybody says it is. When I first saw it I loved it but looking back on it, it just doesn't hold up to me as it did before. I can understand why Marlin is so over protective over his son because he lost his wife and other kids. But for one Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) was annoying. A lot of people say that Dory is funny but I disagree I thought she was irritating. I just wanted to strangle her. She kept on forgetting everything. At around the end of the movie she says to Marlin (Nemo's dad) that she ""Remembers stuff whenever she's around her"" Um I have to call BS on that because the only thing she could remember was Sydney and she couldn't remember anything else. And the sharks. The sharks are hypocrites. They say that ""Fish are friends! Not food!"" but you clearly see a shark with fish bones in its mouth. That's really hypocritical! Sometimes Marlin got annoying with how overprotective he was. I mean god I thought Simba was over protective in Lion King 2 but Marlin tops him! The music in the movie is nothing special. You might think that I hate this movie because of the negative things I have said about it no I don't hate it. I liked the turtles, the birds that repeatedly said ""Mine!"", the main character that was a bird that helped Marlin and Dory. The plot was good enough to keep me interested but as I have said, it's overrated. Doesn't top Toy Story 1-3. So I give Finding Nemo a 6 out of 10.",neutral
"Even as a kid sitting in the theater seeing this movie not once or twice, but three times, I can distinctly remember becoming quite antsy before the end. It's a slower-paced movie than a lot of the other Pixar films and, quite frankly, it bored me a lot. My mother liked it, so I went along with it, but it was never my kind of thing.It's a beautifully animated film that's appealing to look at, and it hasn't lost a bit of its quality in that regard with the passing of time. The voice acting is great and, according to Google, it was scored by Randy Newman (who, yet again, I'm not a big fan of). But the biggest appeal of this film is Ellen Degeneres playing the forgetful fish Dory. She was the comic relief in an otherwise grim film, and I think a big part of the film's appeal relies on her and her ability to offer up the lighthearted forgetfulness and stupidity.Overall, though, even on subsequent viewings, the film doesn't really do a lot for me in terms of maintaining interest. It's most definitely worth a watch for anyone who hasn't seen it before, but it's not in my top 5 Pixar films.",neutral
"It has a good story.Rather than that,it's not funny or interesting.Can't understand why it's overrated",neutral
"Many of the earliest screen savers were of fish tanks - so perhaps it's fitting than an early computer-animated movie should have told a story of tropical fish. Some of Pixar's movies have had dark, poetic sides to them; but 'Finding Nemo' is a straight up children's adventure, with a whole shoal of colourful characters, a fast pace, and a positive, upbeat message. A few things made me smile but to me this is vanilla Pixar; there's a one dimensional story here, with little underlying depth, and the gorgeous animation is something we have come to take for granted from this studio. Compare, for example, the opening of this film and that of their later movie 'Up'; they cover similar ground, but the later film's treatment is altogether more poignant and adult.",neutral
"Finding Nemo was clever, cute, well written and definitely a technical advance in animated story telling.  It doesn't compare, however, to the first Pixar film I viewed - Toy Story.My main complaint is that the story moves through so many locations (if I can use that term for an animated movie), that by the end, everything seems rushed.  While I understand that the whole premise of the story is a journey, the writers might have been better off spending more time in three or four locales, than hurrying through 10+.  That said, my daughter loved it!6/10  (my daughter, 10/10)",neutral
Its basically the fish version of the Wizard of Oz. The fish gets taken and then must find its way back home.1 tiny fish in 1 gigantic ocean.The only difference is the red shoes can't fit him? Her?,neutral
"Being a film that titillated female viewers, children, and even some men alike, ""Finding Nemo""'s awe-inspiring animation and wonderful voice work may have caste the illusion that this well-made little film is something of a masterpiece. In reality, Nemo floats well, but there's not much beneath the surface, making it an enjoyable but over-hyped cgi flick.The film borrows heavily the pacing formula of the brilliant ""Toy Story"", and that's not really a bad thing. What gives the film it's mass appeal is undoubtedly, aside from the stunning graphics, the characters. Although I couldn't really connect with them, I can see why so many enjoy watching them. Dorry is the conventional half-wit (Sid from Ice Age, Donkey from Shrek) who for no real reason other then for conventional cinematic interest, finds herself accompanying Marlin on his journey to locate his missing son out of the vast ocean. Just a small twist, she has short term memory loss. I comment frequently on the use of the suspension of disbelief. I don't usually have a problem with it, depending on the context and how often it's used. Here, the unreality of the film leaps out at me with it's teeth barred. Not everyone who boats lives by the shore, and even though Marlin was lucky enough to have his son's captor live so close to the ocean, just how was he planning on getting up there without the help of a winged sympathetic fish-a-vore? Still, the film has enough whimsy for that not to get too problematic, but it allows the writer a lot of area in creating the story, and I wasn't as impressed with the results as others, aside from the films sporadic strong points.Dorry is bubbly and fun for many to watch. Just like with the tepid ""Ice Age"", it takes more then a character who's easy on the eyes and ears to become a character worthy of layering. She doesn't really improve or change much over the course of the film, she just occasionally in a very Disney-like fashion unintentionally helps Marlin escape some near fatal situations. Marlin has the task of forming a friendship with her, because she can grow a tad bit annoying. There's Nemo, who's blow up at his father seems rather unwarranted. I'd assume Nemo knows his siblings were killed by the hundreds, and I'd think he'd at least sympathize with his father for being so overprotective. He can still get upset, but to use the word ""hate""? And of course there's the tank gang, another hoot to watch (each having a cartoon personality), and the serious Gil.Back to the story, it's basically our heroes almost getting eaten, and nemo's attempts at an orthodontist's office to escape his aquatic prison. Some of the sequences succeed better the others. The film also revels in not demeaning animals who happen to be carnivorous, another plus. The film also quite well provides more then shallow entertainment for everyone, and I mean everyone. As long as you're not to young to watch a movie, ""Finding Nemo"" is accessible. That's the film's strongest quality, but aside from that, it really isn't anything much more. Some of the emotion seems trite and ill-proportioned, moving back and forth from believable to not so much. Being a kid's flick, it certainly is better then many other films out there. It just doesn't tackle that much in order to be considered over so many other films, which is usually the case. The story is very linear and it doesn't amaze that well outside of itself. The animation not only delivers, it delivers a natural biome that in itself is one of the most amazing places on earth. The animation on the fish is glorious, capturing the realistic way in which real fish move and partnering it with comedic human movement. The animated reef with it's human makeover, however, is even more brighter and colorful then most actual reefs. The film is like an inviting turquoise pool with a temperature of 85 degrees. And with a riveting score and perspective camera angles, the film launches itself away from other shtick to become noticed, but in my opinion, not really all the praise is worth it.",neutral
"Finding Nemo: 6/10: As a kid's movie Finding Nemo is great. If somehow your munchkins don't already own a copy, have the toys or God forbid seen the ice show (there is something about fish on ice that's a bit creepy. Funny but creepy.) Feel free to buy a copy. You'll get your moneys worth, as the little animatrons will undoubtedly view it endlessly.But as an adult with no little minds of my own to feed the movie left me wanting. For one thing I've seen it before... about a hundred times before. Parent loses kid, kid loses dog, dog loses family, family loses toy, and so forth. Then the endless journey filled with danger, setbacks and endless comic relief characters begins. Finding Nemo, at least narratively, doesn't bring anything new to the party. The fact that Pixar themselves are guilty of using this exact same plot in all their movies doesn't help matters. (Pixar's next feature The Incredibles would actually break this trend somewhat and is the most adult friendly toon of theirs to date) The simple fact is after being spoiled by Shrek (or even Ice Age) I like my kids films to be more accommodating to adults. Not that some things don't work very well indeed (Bruce the 12 step shark and the ""mine, mine, mine,"" seagulls are particularly effective). It's just that the whole film had a cloying sentimentality I usually associate with NBC Olympic coverage or a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie about a Depression Christmas.That said kids will love it. The animation is spectacular. And as these things go it certainly is very well done. Just not my cup of tea I guess. I prefer my fish with a little more biteآ… and lemonآ… and butter.",neutral
"This is great entertainment, don't get me wrong, but i can't help feeling that Disney is cheating the consumer by making movies more like products than artworks. There are some new jokes in this movie, but they've just used the same formula they've been using since Walt was a boy.
When Shrek first came out, i thought - wow! Disney has taken a big leap here. It was clever, satirical, and hugely funny.Then, when Monster's Ink, Toy Story 2 and then Finding Nemo came out, it made me remember every single handdrawn Disney since the forties - there's always two people, usually males, a big person and a little person, at first they don't get along, and at the end they realise the most important thing - their friendship. Shrek and Donkey, Buzz and Woody, Sulley and Mike, Flik and the circus bugs, Simba and Nala, Timon and Pumba, Fox and Hound, Beauty and Beast, Lilo and Stitch, Mermaid and Flounder, Lady and Tramp, Mannie and Sid (Ice Age), Dumbo and Timothy Q Mouse, Pinnochio and Jiminy Cricket, Alladin and Abu, the list goes on. Ooh, i almost forgot: Marlin and Dory.It was sweet the first time, but by now its tired. The latest toy off the production line is ""Brother Bear""... need i say more?Give us something remotely new, innovative, like the small step forward Shrek was.",neutral
"The line between fantasy and reality is becoming rapidly blurred. It seems that all computer-animated movies are doing extremely well, while the hand-drawn ones seem to be either direct-to-video sequels nobody wanted, box office bombs, or have horrendous ideas. Finding Nemo may soon be the highest grossing animated movie ever, simply because it's easy to look at. It's not as good as Pixar's other movies because it lacks the one key ingredient that made Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. work so well. Most kids never feared of being taken away by a man and being put into a fish tank in a dentist's office. However, I don't think there's a child alive who never thought that their toys moved when they weren't there or that there were monsters in the closet. Because of this, Finding Nemo couldn't connect as well, because, simply, it wasn't something that anyone thought of in real life.The plot has Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clownfish who can never tell good jokes, with his wife Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) (where DO they get these names?), who just moved into a new home. A shark, however, eats Coral and all but one of her eggs. A few years later, Marlin raises Nemo (Alexander Gould) in an overprotective environment. To prove his dad wrong, Nemo swims out into the open ocean and is scooped up by a diver. Marlin goes on a search to find Nemo, and, along the way, meets over-the-top Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss.Finding Nemo has lavish landscapes. It really looks like the ocean, and, although none of the fish or creatures in the ocean looked real, they were well done. The best animation that Pixar does is with real things (like in the opening short, Knick Knack). Although they have some work to do with humans to make them look realistic, a few scenes, set in a doctor's office, looked incredibly real. Maybe if Pixar and PDI (who did Shrek) exchange secrets than Pixar could have better looking humans and PDI could have more realistic surroundings.The only character that made me constantly laugh in this comedy was Dory. Although most of the target audience would not understand most of it, her short-term memory loss was a genius addition to the script. She was so uninhibited, it was really hilarious. However, Brooks, as Marlin, didn't really do much for me. If his ability to not be able to tell a joke had been played out more, it would've worked more. His paranoid behavior also ebbed and flowed, while if he had another quirk that he could do throughout the movie, would've worked more, also. The fun part about animated movies is all of the voices. I couldn't tell most of them, but I did recognize Willem Dafoe. Others include Allison Janney, Brad Garrett, Erik Per Sullivan, Stephen Root, Vicki Lewis, and Geoffrey Rush.There's not a real moral to Finding Nemo. What is there to learn? All I've learned is from the opening credits that snowmen desperately want to leave their snowglobes. Basically, Finding Nemo won't go into the same category as Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.. Instead, it'll probably go into the `forgotten' category like A Bug's Life.My rating: 6/10Rated G.",neutral
"Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie. But I expected more. I would call it entertaining and worth a watch, but not up to the level of Monsters Inc. or Dreamworks Shrek. The graphics were awesome, but I left with a feeling that is could have been a better movie. I went with my friend and his 5 year old and there were some parts that were a bit scary for him (the 5 year old, not my friend). He still enjoyed the movie however. The story seems to resonate with the parents I talked to which may explain why it has such a high rating. I just expected a little more.",neutral
"Finding Nemo is an okay movie. The idea is good and original, butthe beginning is very sad and too much of the same thing washappening. The very funny parts were in the fish tank that Nemogets captured in.What happens is that Nemo is a an only child, or only fish, if youwant to say that. He lives with his overprotective father. On the firstday of school his dad catches him not being with the group and heand his friends are having a contest to see who can get closer to""the butt"" (a boat). Nemo's dad gets mad so, to prove that he'sbrave, Nemo swims up and touches ""the butt"". He gets capturedby scuba divers and put in a tank in a dentist's office. He meetsmany crazy fish and it's a fun movie once you get into it. But it's alittle slow and I really wanted to smack Dory, a fish who teams upwith Nemo's dad, Marlin, to go and find Nemo. I also wanted tosmack Marlin. Of course, there are corny parts at the end but, it'sDisney. What can you expect? I'd probably give this film 6 out of 10stars because it's funny and sort of original, but it's slow andannoying.",neutral
"I am in my mid-thirties and have always enjoyed the Pixar movies. Can't say i didn't like this movie but I was expecting more. I thought Ice Age for example did a better job of entertaining adults. Had more humor and was better executed for adults - and also satisfied children. Both movies also were out of this would visually.As for Nemo, Visually A+. And I did think it had it's touching moments. I didn't find Dory all that funny. Okay she has short term memory loss. Didn't amuse me.After leaving the theater I recalled how my mom wanted my dad to take her to see this movie. My wife and I thought would he enjoy it. And I thought no, I don't think he would. It was too much of a kids movie. And don't get me wrong it was supposed to be. I just wanted to offer a different perspective of this movie. It is not flawless. It's not for everyone as reviews seem to indicate.Actually I enjoyed listening to all the little kids reacting to the movie. My daughter is too young for this one yet - a baby. One thing I was thinking was that this movie might be a little too scary for some of these kids. I would say there were at least 6 times when 'the fish' almost died. There where some scary predators - including humans. After all these are little fish - little fish make good food for big fish. Which would be fine but the predators were also very scary looking. Geez, when I was a kid the Wicked Witch in Wizard of Oz scared me, that is nothing compared to the creatures in this movie.Also, when watching this movie I could already see a sequel. I would bet that Dolphins have a very big role in the second one since they were almost ignored here.",neutral
"Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naأ¯ve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes آ– from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes آ– ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents.",positive
"Yes you read that correctly.Finding Nemo had brilliant, breathtaking underwater scenes that blow your mind!! Characters that you connect with, that have emotion, style and humour. The soundtrack is perfect to boot. Honestly what more could you ask for? In glorious 4K HDR with vibrant Dolby Atmos it gives this iconic classic a whole new life!!",positive
"I didn't see this movie until it came out on DVD. My family and I don't go to the movies very often, mostly because there's hardly anything worth seeing.But this movie was absolutely flawless. The voice cast was super. The voice of Nemo is Alexander Gould, who is 11 years old now. I saw his picture, and I really like his smile.""Finding Nemo"" is a classic. It'a among my favorite movies, and is a movie everyone should see. Unlike about 96% of movies, this movie is Rated ""G"", and can be viewed by children. There might be a few moments when it gets ""scary,"" but they soon turn into comedy.Watch ""Finding Nemo"" and I think you'll be a happier person by the end of the movie!My Score: 10/10.",positive
"Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named ""Shark Bait"". He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react. The animators have done their homework for this picture.This movie is quite an experience. It is a film the whole family can enjoy for years to come. It is a timeless adventure that people can enjoy. Don't let this film drift out to sea...",positive

It's the best movie I've EVER seen, and I know I say that about alot movie, but I actually mean it this time. Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would.",positive

"Pixar has made some of the enjoyable films in the past years: The Toy Story films, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life to name a few. What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in ""Finding Nemo"" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlin's parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whale's mouth.As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.",positive
"My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail. I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it clichأ©, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.Rating: ***** out of 5.",positive

Building an alliance with Pixar and distributing Pixar's genius speaks well of the good chairman.I guess I was not surprised that(at the advanced screening of the new Pixar/Disney flix,) ""Finding Nemo"" would be brilliant. Entertaining my 5 1/2 year old child, my wife and I, ""Nemo"" made for a great family event. Yes, my son will make sure I pay for a second showing... and you know, I will gladly do so.I guess, all tolled, this animated movie should make $250 million easy. Perhaps $300 million... Okay, let's go for it! $366 million.Enjoy.",positive
"""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish named Marlin losing his son Nemo. This movie is about friendship and how friends can help you accomplish the hardest things in life. ""Finding Nemo"" is story written and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2003. Finding Nemo is about a clown fish named Marlin looking for his captured son Nemo. In this journey, Marlin meets a blue tang fish named Dory. Dory is a fish that is suffering from memory loss, but she helps Marlin find Nemo. Both Marlin and Dory face great danger, and hard situations in this journey. Meanwhile, Nemo is trying really hard to find a way to get out of the dentist's fish tank and find his way to the open sea in search of his father. But it's not that easy when you have Darla the fish killer (the little girl with the braces). ""Finding Nemo"" is a great Animated Movie. The movie uses amazing shades and colors, great sound effects, and amazing camera angles. In the scene where the diver pops up in front of the screen is amazingly realistic, it makes the audience feel like they are the ones in the movie. It also makes the audience feel like they are the clown fish when a huge human face pops up in front of the camera; the audience would feel small and also panic like Nemo. The director of the movie (Andrew Stanton) did an amazingly great job at animating the movie and adding scenes that will make the audience feel what the characters are feeling.The theme of the movie is there throughout the whole movie, but the audience realizes it near the end of the movie. The theme of the movie is friendship, and Marlin was able to accomplish his goal when Dory helped him through all the danger they faced. Another place friendship was used was when Nemo was captured in the fish tank in the doctor's office, where Nemo's friends saved his life from getting flushed down the toilet.""Finding Nemo"" is one of the BEST animated movies Pixar Animation Studios made. I strongly recommend for everyone to watch this movie. This movie would make you feel like you are in the movie and not watching the movie.10/10",positive
"Pixar has done it again! That is a phrase we have become accustomed to hearing these past few years. Pixar Animation Studios has taken the children's movie industry by storm. Andrew Stanton takes us head first into the beautiful, strangely bewildering, world of the big blue ocean with Finding Nemo. We expected children to be captivated by this new installment of children's animation, but parents are also catching the wave as well. This isn't just some fish tale! Okay, well maybe it is. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a paranoid, highly overprotective clown fish. His son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is a young child full of energy, enthusiasm, with a dash a rebellion thrown in there. Nemo was left crippled at birth after an attack that took his mother and all of his siblings. This leaves NEmo with a deep desire to be independent. This is shown while on a school field trip. Nemo, trying to show off to some friends swims out into open waters. A pair of divers come from the darkness and kidnap Nemo. Marlin, with the help a newly found and hilariously forgetful friend Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) start the adventure to save the only thing that he has left in this world. Little did they know Marlin and Dory will run into all sorts of roadblocks along the way. They encounter sharks that have sworn off eating fish, a horrifying Angler Fish, a bale of sea turtles, and a forest of jellyfish. All of this just to track down his son. That's what I call being a good dad! Finding Nemo is the perfect mixture of a great story, witty comedy, and enticing animation. The bright colors of the underwater world are extravagant. The dialogue keeps viewers entertained and laughing. While the depth of the story of a father losing his son hooks them in for good. This tale is fit for all, young and old. When a child sits down to watch this movie, they can relate to Nemo. A young child looking to do his own thing and go on some adventures. Nemo grows along the course of the film. He goes from being a rebellious little punk, to someone who understands the importance of family and how much his father loves him. As Nemo grows, any child who watches him grows as well. This is one of many reasons why this is a fantastic movie for children. As Pixar will continue to reel in fantastic stories every year, Finding Nemo will go down as one of their greatest hits. Children and parents are flocking to this new spectacle. This thrilling tale will warm the hearts of fathers everywhere who care for their children. Although Marlin could be a little extreme at times, it was very clear that he would do anything for his Son. I believe I echo the words of everyone saying that we want more from Pixar.",positive
"Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters. Along the way, we are given the treat of having some amazing comedy bits as characters cultures clash amongst one another. But even as we travel across the ocean and back, the core of the story never leaves us, it's a love story about a father and son and it is an emotional roller-coaster. They brilliantly take the most notorious fish movie, Jaws (which made the ocean seem terrifying), and turns it upside down, making the water now seem like a wonderful land full of amazing creatures. Finding Nemo is the epitome of Pixar's imagination and creative abilities, they have made an eternal classic here.Let's hope the sequel lives up to the first film!",positive

"When I grew up, I always thought the concept of Pixar movies was ""what would life be like as a ____"" Toys were fun, Monsters in the cupboard were fun, bugs were fun, and now we landed on fish. And I loved it because it was colourful and funny and touching.Now, watching Finding Nemo with all I know about film, I am able to understand how brilliant early Pixar was. Every one of these early films has two ""whats life like as"" - one for kids (toys, bugs, monsters) and one for adults. In Finding Nemo, its ""what life is like as an overprotective parent."" Finding Nemo is one of the most beautiful stories that can appeal to families that I've ever seen.The film opens with one of the most downright upsetting moments I ever watched as a child. Albert Brooks' perfect voice casting really captures the grief and desperation that Marlin feels, and it so perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the film. Every one of Marlin's overprotective scenes is not completely justified, but so believable to come from him. We also enjoy Ellen DeGeneres' delightful sidekick Dory, who is absolutely hilarious and charming and I could not love her presence more. As Marlin and Dory set out on the titular quest, Pixar does what Pixar does best - gives us a funny and wondrous understanding of their universe. A gang of sharks are recovering addicts from fish flesh. Seagulls are sadistic and brainless. A group of sea turtles are perpetually high. Throughout each of the encounters, not only does Marlin learn more about the ocean he has been afraid of for so long, but he learns about how his overprotective parenting isn't going to help Nemo forever, and he's better off learning to take care of himself wherever he can.Meanwhile, Nemo is confined in a dentist's tank with a gaggle of kooky fish characters, each of whom has their own little ticks because of their confinement (a beautiful little addition to the story). Emmy king and queen Brad Garrett and Allison Janney are hilarious and even funnier is the addition of Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush, who pops in as a Pelican taking an interest in dental hygiene. The film's story is so perfectly constructed that I can't fault it. The catalyst moments are spread out by moments of character development and sprinkled with perfect doses of humour. Even the final challenge doesn't come across as ""just one more obstacle"" but provides closure on Marlin's overparenting and provides his first real test. Thomas Newman's serene score keeps things moving along at a beautiful pace, and the animation is as superb as anything we've come to expect from Pixar.Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple. Its a lesson to kids and parents alike, but its also so colourful and funny that its a fun watch just when you're feeling flat. Perfect for all occasions.",positive
"Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.The plot follows a clown fish named Marlin, that after his son is taken by a human, sets out on a dangerous and treacherous journey to get him back. Along the way he will meet Dory, a blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Together they will stop at nothing to get to Nemo, Marlin's son, who along with a group of ragtag aquarium fish will also plan to escape to the ocean in order to avoid a bratty, but, deadly child and get back to his dad.So like I said, there 3 reasons why I love this movie. The first one is the comedy, provided mostly by the goofy sidekick Dory, as well as other characters. The combination of the smart script, plus the voice talent involved makes for the great comedic side of Finding Nemo. The other great quality of the script, is the emotional turmoil that ensues in the movie, and personally I believe that some parents might resonate with it most, even though I myself do not know this reality. Finally Pixar proves why they are the top of the animation game, by assembling the proper research and creating a great oceanic world, as well as the Sydney landscape.Finding Nemo will forever be a cinematic mark in my cinematic history. It is a funny, energetic and entertaining picture, and that is all I can ask from a movie like this. Rating: 10/10",positive
"Finding Nemo is the heroic tale of fishes, and it's excellent. It opens up with a tragedy and quickly leads us to a great adventure and multiple acts of courage. Who would have thought that such a simple idea could result in such a great production?The animation is extremely colorful, brought to us in great details for a breathtaking look at the life under the sea. The dialogs are funny. The script is very inventive and doesn't call on evil or songs. The story is riveting, with each scene a novelty in itself. Voices are chosen to perfection, and the reactions realistic.A great movie for both adults and kids.",positive
"Finding Nemo is one of a series of Pixar animation features made in past decade or so and is probably the best of the lot. My three year old watches the DVD at least twice a week and doesn't show any sign of getting tired. The reason is obvious - Finding Nemo creates a complete under the sea world inhabited by creatures with complete personalities.The plot has Marlin, a clown fish, losing his only child Nemo (named after Capt.Nemo of 20,000 leagues under the the sea) to a deep sea diver. While Nemo is stuck in a fish tank in a dental office with lots of other interesting characters, Marlin sets out to find his son. On the way, a crazy blue fish called Dory joins him and turns this into something of a buddy movie (although Dory is female)......There are lots of jokes peppered throughout the movie with Dory supplying a large chunk of them. Writer-director Stanton plays a 'dude' 150 year old sea turtle straight from the 60's and adds to the fun. The visuals are superb, storyline is great and it all makes for a great adventure. I rate this 9/10 because I'm a little sick and tired of seeing it on the DVD every weekend for over a year now!!",positive
"There is nothing I can say about the movie that has never been told before. The music was great, the voices were great, the scenario and direction was magnificent. A fascinating story, made by the creators of masterpieces, Pixar...If I could, I would talk about this movie forever, or until I run out of words and adjectives. The story is funny and touching when it's necessary. It made me laugh out loud and even cry for a second. Fantastic. A must-see! Excellent work by the musicians and the director. That's just it. If I go on, I will get on your nerves as I am extremely enthusiastic about this movie. THE movie, actually.",positive
"Finding Nemo is a very good animated film, probably it's in the top 10 animated features of all time. The story is about a little clown fish named Nemo. He ventures out into the open sea while not listening to his father. He gets captured by a dentist and now his father, marlin has to save him from the clutches of the dentist and his ""evil"" niece. The story of the film is unbelievable. I don't know how a movie about a fish can be very popular. The voice acting is pretty good. The all-star cast did a great job voicing their characters. The music in this film is sweet. The music will lure you more into the movie. The song in the film is great for people who like music 40 years ago. Once again, Pixar did not fail in its ability to make classic animated films. Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.",positive

"I really enjoyed this movie from day one. I can't help but to find myself watching 'NEMO"" every now and again. This movie has a great story line, and will keep you anxious based on the characters. I will have to say that ""DORI"" played by the wonderful Ellen DeGeneres would be my favorite character in the whole movie. I love how comedic she is. She is clumsy, forgetful, and well you will just have to watch the movie to really she how funny she is. This movie is perfect for all ages, I'm 19 and I still watch it. I can't tell you how excited I am for the movie ""Finding Dori""to come out. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely a 10/10.",positive
"Pixar makes the best animated films and Finding Nemo is one more jewel in their crown. Like most Pixar movies, Finding Nemo too deals with universal themes آ– parenting, father-son relationship & friendship. With his crisp, funny & sometimes thought-provoking dialogues, director Andrew Stanton takes you on an adventure ride under the rich and colorful sea full of interesting creatures. This movie is so engrossing that you sometimes forget it is just an animation, especially when you see animated characters display genuine human emotions. Dory is the most unforgettable character I've come across in animated movies. Other characters too remain etched in your memory long after you've seen the movie. This movie certainly deserves a spot among the top movies of this century.",positive
"God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their ""secret"". No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. ""Finding Nemo"" is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best.",positive
"Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.",positive
"There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks). As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.Visually, ""Finding Nemo"" is stunning. Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.In terms of humor, ""Nemo"" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling. It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.The main plot line--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors. Though nothing may ever quite top ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"" belongs on that ""1-B"" slot right along with ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"".",positive
"I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me.First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.Most importantly though is the story. Nemo's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.",positive
"Finding Nemo may be my favorite Pixar movie. I've first seen it as a kid in 2003, and I instantly got obsessed with it and I've watched it numerous times.Finding Nemo is about a clownfish named Marlin and his son Nemo living in the ocean. Nemo is then captured by us humans, and Marlin is desperate to find his son, who is ""imprisoned"" in an aquarium in a dental clinic in Australia.The characters are perfectly voiced by Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould. Ellen is also charming as the voice of the hilarious Blue Hippo Tang with short-term memory loss named Dory. The movie is animated beautifully with a moving soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman.Finding Nemo is an unforgettable film that will still capture the hearts of many in the years to come.",positive
"An overprotective father attempts to find his kidnapped son, all the while learning about what it means to have a real relationship built on trust and mutual understanding.This movie feels perfect still today. No line or moment feels wasted. The film is perfectly entertaining. Every character feels real, fleshed out, and developed. For a movie about talking fish, it is surprising grounded in real human experiences and emotions.I would be hard pressed to find someone who would actively dislike this movie. It is a film that captures the complexities, joys, and sorrows of being human in a way that speaks to adults and children.",positive

"Finding Nemo is the compelling story of a fish taken by divers, and his dad searches the entire ocean looking for his son. This movie it great for all ages. A 4 years old and an 84 year old will be entertained by he touching story of this movie. It is here kids learn it is okay to accept help, the ones who truly love you will never give up on you, and just keep swimming, no matter what never give up. I give this movie two thumbs up and would recommend it to anybody. This movie is a Disney classic. I have nothing bad to say about it. The animation is astounding for the time the movie came out. As a result of this movie kids all over the world go to aquariums looking to find Nemo and Dory. Maybe they will find a 100 year old sea turtle as well. This movie is not only entertaining but education as well. This move is unforgettable.",positive
"Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.Andrew Stanton plays the viewer like a fiddle, and it's a privilege to be played. Its animation is truly stunning, awash (pun intended) in a dazzling array of colors and creating the impression of a living, breathing sea. Every moment is magnificently orchestrated to tease a response from us - anything from awe to aw-shucks. Yes, it's a visual feast, but more importantly it's an epic journey filled with adventure and discovery that encompasses the grandest sweep of the ocean's vastness and the tiniest longing of the heart. While preserving the characters' intrinsic ""fishy-ness"", the silver- tongued voice cast offers great supplementary texture to a marvelous sensory experience. While Brooks is amusing as the ever fretful Marlin, it is DeGeneres who gives a bravura comic performance as the guileless but whacked-out Dory. Ceaselessly forgetful, her endearing Dory makes a difficult traveling companion but a scintillating friend â€“ Dory is a complete hoot.Instead of rising to a challenge, Finding Nemo plunges into it and comes up a winner. All in all, a buoyant adventure that manages to evoke the quicksilver trait of the ocean without necessarily feeling 'wet'!",positive
"It's so fun and enjoyable and greatly written with an excellent story line. The actors were superb, we felt a mix of emotions through the viewing. Definitely a movie for all ages. We can tell that the producers of this film worked hard to bring to life the under water world in such an engaging and comedic way, and the quality of animation, captivating bright colours and suited cinematography, as expected was fantastic which we felt also aided the entire viewer experience. With each character's unique personality being perfectly distinguished in a clever way highlighted much creativity and places this particular movie at the top of the our list of awesomely produced animated films. If you haven't seen this film we encourage you to do so and be prepared for an experience and be taken into another world. Do watch and thoroughly enjoy! A great ""must see""!",positive
"This must be the best kids movie of all time.Funny and heart-warming, it'll leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Beautifully made. Expertly animated. Very well written Superbly acted. I have seen this several times and notice new stuff every time. Ellen DeGeneres is fabulous. Far superior to the likes of Shark Tale. Ten lines is a lot to expect in a review about a film, you don't think that ten lines is an awful lot until you start to write a review for a film and then you actually realise that ten lines is actually a lot of lines to write and repeat yourself. I have tried not to repeat myself but not really very hard. Perhaps if I was to try harder not to repeat myself then the task of not repeating would be easier but as the situation stands at the moment, I fear that I might be repeating myself, perhaps I could go swimming in the sea or in a swimming pool or a lake or loch or a big puddle.",positive
"I have to admit it... I am hooked on animations. Did you get it? :)OK. This is another proof that animations are for all ages and if the story is good and it has a moral that relates to all of us, it's a success.Really well done. Great voice acting. Fluid animation and cute characters that are alive.Loved it! Watched it several times... and every time you discover something new...Try to catch the pelican saying ""nice"" with an Australian accent and flying way... did you get the reason? Hilarious. Smooth humour.All together: Beautiful!",positive
"There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.",positive
"This is one of my favorite Pixar movies! I could sit and watch this movie all day. It's one of those movies that will never get old. To this day, I still cry when Nemo's mom dies. I find this movie to be not only family-friendly, but age appropriate. Anybody of any age can sit down and watch this movie. The variety of ocean life that they use is great for young children because it teaches them what animals live in the ocean. It's one of those movies that's perfect for family movie night or just simply at a sleepover. When I was in high school, my government teacher gave us a movie day and this was the movie of choice. Everybody in the class was so excited and nobody complained. I highly recommend this movie, especially with younger children. You're never too old or too young to watch Nemo.",positive
"A breath-taking movie. Pixar had created a wonderful world through animation. A real treat for our eyes. Great story. Great comedy. Great action. Great adventure. Great world. Great characters. Great ride. My favorite, the fish Dora.It's about a father fish trying to get back his son fish who had been kidnapped by humans to Sydney. He travels all over the ocean to get his son back no matter what it cost him. An amazing movie about a father's love for his son.All praise goes to the creators. They have done an amazing job. Capital ""A""mazing. The animation water-world and fishes looks so realistic in nature. One of major plus point for Pixar Studios. They are real artist. Their hard work had really paid off.It's no surprise for this movie to be awarded the Best animated movie of the year.",positive
"I've seen this movie at least twice, parts of it four or five times...the humor resonates on all levels (not just age levels, but visual versus audio, double indentures. etc, and reflects realities of modern industrial family and existential experience; it's a simple but great story line (although, much of the entertainment is in a series of vignettes; characters you (well, sort of) care about; spectacular animation. The casting of actors doing the voices is about as good as it gets. One of the amazing things for me in watching this movie a second and third time was the subtleties in the facial expressions and these animated characters. I highly recommend this movie - even for people (such as myself) who don't normally care for animated films.",positive
"possibly the second best animated movie of all time (first being Aladdin) and it is definitely the funniest!! the story was great, and the jokes are unforgettable. props to whoever played dory, because that was the FUNNIEST talking fish i have ever seen in my life. the fish in tanks were cute, and the turtles were cool. i liked the sharks, and the way nemo's name was constantly mispronounced (fabio, etc.) i wouldn't necessarily recommend it for really little kids, as it was a little sad. but overall, i absolutely loved it. i hope they come up with some sort of sequel that doesn't absolutely ruin it, but even if they don't , it's still an absolutely awesome movie.",positive
"Pixar Studios is one of the world's most exciting and cool film studios. They deliver every single time for the whole family; fun, dramatic, brilliance, entertainment, moral...everything! Before this instalment Pixar has given us TOY STORY 1/2, A BUG'S LIFE and MONSTERS INC. that's all extremely good films! This, last one, FINDING NEMO is just as jolly good!
We follow Marlin, a clown-fish that's on a desperat look for his only child, Nemo, that as said before is the only survivor after their family was brutally attacked by a barracuda and almost everybody were eaten. Marlin hooks up with another fish that shows herself to have extremely bad memory and forgets thing almost before she's get to know them! Now, these two goes on the search of Nemo, who's lost in the big blue ocean, where there are sharks, bombs, whales, birds and much more!The story is this time probably the best detail, off course together with the humour that is also brilliant fun! It is packed with funny scenes and the animation is getting more and more stunning, the dialogs are brilliant, everything works as good as it gets! Dozens of genius characters are packed into this story. It is a very choosy movie and it keeps up it's entertainment in a very fine way, the only thing that's something to put anything on is the end, that's really nothing. But the rest of the movie is pure entertainment and is very, very nice watching! FINDING NEMO's got entire scenes. Like the one with the three sharks that has decided to form a club where they have to promise that they shall not eat other fishes, cause that's cannibalism. Either it's small characters or big, they're all over the place! You laugh a lot, and if it isn't funny, it's just so entertaining or nice made that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. As the movie goes by you feel a small piece of boring in the middle, but FINDING NEMO fixes it with smacking some more characters and keeping the tempo up and keeping the paralell - story interesting with Nemo actually being caught in a aquarium together with other fishes.STARS: 5/5",positive
"Just saw Finding Nemo this morning (Satyam Cineplex, Chennai, India) one word to comment - 'breathtaking CG work' the entire voice talent team has done a gr8 job too!The colorful coral of the Marlins, the forgetful Dory, the 'Fish are our friends, not Food' Sharks, the mighty Whale, 150 yrs old. Crush - the Turtle and its kiddies in the EAC, the tank and Nemos' Mates at the Dentist's place, they are all too good!!Toy Story, Antz, Shrek ...and now Finding Nemo! lol forgot Darla at the Dentist.. Guess the CG supervisor visualised his worst girl friend at School.. haha.",positive
"It's the best animated film after 'Ice Age'!I've watched it more than 10 times!O.K. I'm exaggerating but It's really great and I think everybody will like it.All the characters are very funny,even the ""bad guys"" are kind of nice.My personal favourites are the sharks!They were so funny! So,everybody watch this film,you're gonna love it!!!",positive
"Finding Nemo has it all...fantastic animation, great story, hilarious comedy, and wonderful voice acting. Ellen, I wish the Academy would create a Best Voice Acting Category and give you the first award. Your work as Dory stole the show.This is one of the few movies I can pull out and watch at any time. Pixar has not won Best Animated Feature yet, and of their body of films, this is the perfect picture to give them their first.",positive
"This is a great movie, and i don't see how anyone can say differently. Pixar has once again made magic using cg. I swear sometimes it is hard to see the difference between computer animations and real film. I find that especially the ocean is masterfully done. If you haven't already seen this movie, go see it now!",positive
"`Finding Nemo' is one of the best, perhaps THE best, animated films ever made آ– in a class with the Disney masterpieces, `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' `Pinocchio,' and `Bambi.'  It is gorgeous to look at, exciting, funny آ– often very funny آ– and moving. `Finding Nemo' is a great film, 10 out of 10.",positive
"Yeah, like what the title of the comment says... I just like the movie just a little bit less than Shrek (who can forget: CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS OVER A PINT?) but I laughed more than during the times I watched Shrek. It's -to my honest opinion- a lot funnier than Ice Age. And the story is beautifully realized, without overdoing it, like Disney sometimes does.
And eeeeeeuuuuuuh... I SPEAK WHALE!!!",positive
"This is truly the best animated film ever. It is pure Disney magic. In my opinion it was the best film of the summer of 2003. It also has to be the funniest Disney movie ever made. I hope there is a sequel to this. The only problem is what they are going to call it. They'll have to call it something else unless they're finding Nemo again. Anyway, getting back to this movie, I thought that the absent-minded fish Dori was the funniest character. I also thought those Seagulls that always said ""Mine"" was funny. For some reason when I first saw the movie I thought those Gulls were saying ""Mike"". Then I realized that they couldn't say ""Mike"" because it wouldn't make sense. 10/10. I always love it when Disney and Pixar work together.",positive
"I think its very funny that you people who are insulting Finding Nemo are insulting a G rated, kids movie. Finding Nemo is a very sweet movie and its really cute. I have many younger cousins who are 2 all the way to 12 who really enjoyed this movie and talk about it all the time. So I think its hilarious that adults are coming on this board and ragging on the movie about how stupid it is. And yes, I am aware that G means general audience but G usually means its great for kids. But, yes, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Think about how its for younger audiences before you go on about insulting it. Well I'm going to watch it with my 10 year old brother. Bye!",positive
"This is a fantastic film no matter how old you are. The storyline is good and the graphics are amazing. I am a big fan of Disney and Pixar, but this film, compared to Toy Story and Shrek, is so much better. It's a great family film that will have you upset, excited but most of all it will have you laughing so much all the way through! The best character has got to be Dory because she is just hilarious!",positive
"Quite why I haven't commented on this before is beyond me, but still, here I amPut simply, Finding Nemo is a brilliant film with funny and endearing characters that are a joy to watch. Pixar have again pushed the boundaries of computer animation to bring us a realistic yet still cartoonish film that will appeal to anyone from 3 to 103. I'm sure most people's favourite bit was the whale speak by Dory, which had me in stitches. However other little incidents in the film really made me laugh so much. When the little baby fish falls off the sponge bed is so typical of how children react when they hurt themselves. The animators and writers at Pixar really know how to capture the way people react to situations. All the little facial expressions throughout the film are beautifully animated.The water effects must have been tremendously difficult to achieve, but they are fantastic. The lighting changes that were required really help set the mood of a scene, even when Marlin and Dory were inside the whale. The story although basic was successfully pulled off with no dip in any of the action. The story kept going when it shifted between Marlin's desperate attempt to locate his son, and Nemo's dispair of being alone with no one to look after him except the new collection of strange friends in the dentist fish tank.
Overall I give it 10/10 because it was great. I can't wait for The Incredibles next year, I'm sure it will be just as good.",positive
"A spectacle in every way, this film is guaranteed to delight viewers of all ages. An instant classic, and an example of cinema at its most spellbinding. The animation is cutting edge, the jokes fly thick and fast, there's not too much maudlin sentiment to weigh one down, and the musical score is among the best I've heard in recent years. Flawless!",positive
"Pixar has done it again, it seems that whenever Pixar and Disney come out with a movie it is always a tremendous success, and Finding Nemo is no exception. This is the best Pixar film yet and it will be tough to beat. The visual effects are amazing; everything in this Pixar ocean looks so real, from the sand to the sunlight hitting the water. You almost feel like you're underwater and it's hard to imagine that this is animation is not real. The voice work just adds to the animation and makes the movie that much better. Hands down, Ellen DeGeneres is the best in this movie; her voice work as Dory is just hilarious. Every scene that Dory is in I couldn't help but laugh, and with help from the script, the film has some of the funniest scenes in a children's movie. This movie is perfect for kids as it will amuse and entertain them or whoever else may be watching with them. The animation literally comes alive, the humor is everywhere and this all makes Finding Nemo a movie that is extremely enjoyable to watch.",positive
"With Finding Nemo (which has just been released in cinema's today here in the Netherlands) Pixar once again delivers a true masterpiece, easily the best of their films so far, and maybe even the best animation I've seen (and that long list includes Shrek and The Lion King).All one hopes for is provided: stunning images, lovely music (by Thomas Newman, always a firm favourite), a great story with humour, humanity and warmth, great voice performances... Simply perfect.When the words ""The End"" appeared, the entire cinema was sorry (sighs all around) - that says enough now doesn't it... :-)If you're not one of those ""I only like it when it's noisy and violent"" kind of persons, you'll probably love this film over and over again. Be sure to watch the entire ending titles too as there are some little surprises in it... right until the end.",positive
"I bought this movie on a Vcd when i went on a holiday to Singapore in 2004.Everything about this is fantastic..Photography is amazing.Colors are amazing.Characters are great.Dialogs are wonderful.Story is great.It tells about 2 fishes Marlin and his child Nemo.One day Nemo is taken away.Marlin meets Dory.They go to help to find him.They go to a doctors clinic and see Nemo he is being sent away to a little girl who is destructive.But in the they save Nemo.The acting is brilliant from the characters.Casting was perfect.Voices were great.i know some hated this by calling it a lot of harsh words like Pathetic,Terrible,Waste etc.Forget them this is an awesome movie",positive
"Finding Nemo is honestly one of the few films I count as perfect. From the absolutely stunning animation, a beautiful story, breathe-taking visuals, and some memorable characters (protagonists and side characters alike), this film is just top notch. Watching this as an adult (I watched this so much as a kid) it still holds up extremely well and it's charm still shines bright. Some of Pixar's best work.",positive
"4 Stars: With a sense of imagination that only a child could have, Pixar has finally struck gold. En route to becoming the highest grossing animated movie in history, and deservedly so, Finding Nemo is a real gem for both kids and their parents. Its first move in the right direction is setting the picture underwater. Amid a previously unseen and pleasantly quirky world of spaced-out sea turtles and 12-step program sharks, the movie presents a heartwarming story about a father's search for his son. Add in witty dialogue and extroadinary performances by both Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks and you got a movie that's too good to miss.",positive
"As a kid born in 1998, Finding Nemo was one of the first movies I ever saw in theaters. I know it's not the first, but I cannot remember one prior.Finding Nemo made me fall in love with cinema. I watched it as a small kid, watched it several times since and it still manages to make me feel exactly what it set out to make me feel.To me, this movie is not only a perfectly well written example of what an animated film should be like, it's a masterclass in storytelling, engaging audiences through plots and subplots, perfectly tied by humor, voice acting and and computer animation, which still stands to date (2024).Finding Nemo is a MUST WATCH for every family wanting their kids to find love for filmography.",positive
"I'm 27 years old and I have a 9 year old daughter.  For some strange reason, she didn't want to see Finding Nemo when it came to the theaters, so i said cool, i'll just buy the dvd when it comes out.....big mistake.  I should have listened to my daughter. She hated it along with my 2 nieces, ages 3 & 4, and my nephew, age 5.  The animation was beautiful but the story was.....well.....just BORING.  About 30 minutes into the movie, they were ready to watch something else and frankly, so was I.",negative
"Honestly, I do not understand why so many people love this movie. I can normally watch a disney movie and enjoy myself, but this one simply did not entertain me. First of all, I noticed in Finding Nemo was that there were not any songs. most disney movies have parts where the charectors break into song, not in Finding Nemo. Secondly, I found some of the charectors quite annoying, especially the blue fish. Lastly, the worse thing about Finding Nemo is that so many people talk like it was the best kids movie ever made. Because of this i was expecting another entertaining, fun, and enjoyable kids movie, but instead i wasted an hour and a half of my life.",negative
"After the over-the-top praise this movie received, I was surprised to find it to be an pretty unremarkable movie, and one that's not especially imaginative/visual. It is uncomplicated by any element not approved by committee, which means you get regurgitated under-sea relationships, with slightly modernized shtick. (Yep, there's a shark chase, but he's in recovery ?!) Take any three familiar mass market plot lines and average them together and you get something as tepid as this. This movie was gone from my mind the second it ended. I don't recall a frame of it.The only way you could be a fan of this movie is if you think a movie is supposed to spell everything out for you and cause you to emote every twenty minutes. It never touched me and it never engaged me. Nobody ever went broke tossing look-alike projects at undiscerning American audiences.",negative
"Toy Story again, but with fishes.1 idea, 2 movies..... I'm getting really sick of this - GO TAKE A CREATIVE WRITING CLASS, YOU IDIOTS!Yes, but some truly *amazing* visuals, as always - there must be *something* there to make you part with your hard-earned. (and some parts of that something, for some reason, look very much like a screensaver common in Win98 days that I saw here and there... ??!!!! Maybe Pixar look for their inspiration in more mundane (and obvious!) places than I thought?.... :) )Enjoy on TV, friends places and the like. DON'T PART, etc., etc.,....",negative
"Talk about two of the most irritating characters Pixar has ever created. The overbearing mother Ming and her overly dramatic daughter Mei, made this film extremely difficult to watch. Both characters were beyond insufferable! Pixar is completely losing its touch! This is the 3rd film in a row they make, that I would not want to watch more than once.",negative
"As a Chinese American I have to say that I'm very disappointed by this movie. Seriously what is the movie trying to teach the kids? To be youself and don't listen to your parnets at the age of 13? Or to sneak out of the house at the middle of the night? Or go to a not child appropriate concert without parents permission? The main characters are teens, they are at the very age that can be easily misled by these wrong messages. This is the most irresponsible movie that Pixar has made.",negative
"This film has a decent premise. But the plot and characters feel very cliche and boring, with the main theme being a good message but poorly portrayed.The art style is HORRIBLE. The character models look like some cheap bowling alley screen display characters.This film lacks Disney Pixars magic. What happened to the creativity of Monsters Inc, Up, Coco?",negative
"As a parent of 4. This movie is not for kids especially under the age of 8. It teaches you that it's ok to go behind your parents back and do things you shouldn't be doing. Teaches you betrayal. Teaches you that your friends are more important then family. Teaches you it's ok to lie. Teaches you it's ok to hide secrets from your parents. Teaches you arrogance, it's ok to do whatever you want as a teenager. Lack of discipline, it's ok to be mad and be someone your not suppose to be to fit it. This movie is horrible. Disney what are you doing?!?!?",negative
Straight out the gate this movie not appropriate for all ages and those involved should be ashamed for not giving prior warnings to parents. I have no idea what movie those scoring this highly were watching but it's certainly not the movie I watched.The main character is extremely arrogant and just not relatable or likeable and the mother is so far beyond controlling that she's a borderline psychopath and of course the father is just some overweight dude there for appearances.I've no idea what message this sends to kids but it's not that puberty is natural and part of life but that it's a bizarre rollercoaster and you can pretty much do anything you want when experiencing it.,negative
"I'm a 22 year old female who desires to become a teacher and was disappointed, to say the least, in the message behind this film. Embracing your emotions are important but if your emotions leads you to lie to your parents, listen to your bad influential friends, and care more about the lastest music than caring for other people, then you need to learn not to give into those emotions. It's so sad today to see kids having no respect for their teachers and/or adults who care deeply for them because they've been fed these message that they're allowed to do whatever they want without thinking of the consequences and the effect it has on other people and theirselves later on in life, and wondering when did things starting to go out of hand.""My panda, my choice"" was the response she told her mom when her mom told her that her appearance was inappropriate. It seems innocent but guys, I'm begging you to look at the deeper message. Be careful what you allow your children to watch.",negative
The beginning of the movie is a beautiful and cute description of life as a preteen. But just around the halfway mark the storytelling basically stops and there's nothing but hammer-blow-subtle messaging. If you agree with the message you may not dislike it as much but even you will have to concede the sloppy storytelling and dramatic shift in tone.,negative
"Ok I get I'm not the target audience for this film. That being said I wasn't the target audience for Inside Out or Dora the explorer and I loved those films. Why? Because they were well made with a story and characters and a plot and you know... film stuff. This is just bad. Bad animation, bad voice acting, cringe worthy ""characters"" a plot that isn't and gahhhhhhh I just can't go on. Seriously, no one should be made to sit through this tripe. Pixar what have you become?",negative
"This is a far cry from the Pixar we've grown to love over the years! Disrespect for adults, lying, crude behavior, my kids didn't even laugh! It was detached from reality - no redeeming message and disappointing.",negative
"Everything about this film can be described in one word: cringe. None of the jokes were funny (they were trying way to hard to be relatable to ""fellow kids). The worst part was the animation though. All the characters are so lazily animated and just plain ugly. It looks like something you would see on cartoon network (and I don't mean that in a good way). I was seriously cringing the whole way through the movie. If I hadn't been watching with someone, I probably would have turned it off after the first ten minutes. Actually, on second thought, I wouldn't have watched it at all.",negative
"I wasn't a fan of this film at all. Pixar has had some incredible productions throughout its tenure, but could we be witnessing in real time, the decline on the once great film studio?Don't get me wrong, the animation is good and I'm sure this will turn a profit for them. However, the last couple of films (including this one) that they've released have been a bit of a yawn for me.I'm also not sure I liked the message that it was trying to send, or what I perceived as the message anyway.I liked the inclusivity and yes we need more monitory stories to be told, but overall I wasn't a fan of this.",negative
"This. Just. Sucked. What was the purpose of this? There had to be committees deciding which Pixar movies get made, right, so what group of people sitting around a table thought this was a great Disney/Pixar film? Girls won't like this just because you think you're being relatable by shoving the things girls *don't* want to discuss with strangers, or even family, right on screen where they have to all sit together and pretend it's not uncomfortable. May some people say ""aww, you just have hang-ups""? Maybe, but that's a minority and if they want to make a movie for a small minority - say those that like to host a dinner party and sit down to talk about menstruation and hot dreams, go for it. Otherwise, hopefully lesson learned and they can do better next time.",negative
"Well Congrats guys, Disney somehow found a way to ruin Pixar too. I mean what was that? I'm really disappointed to see such a repetitive and overused plot again and again. The new concepts that company is inforcing to its newer movies, seem just too much. And the characters as much as the creators might think, are not funny or cute.Also, is this an accurate image of the new age? I mean if it is, then ...",negative
Not a comedy. Really just preachy. Kind of want my two hours back. My kids didn't really like it either. Age ten and twelve. If you're looking for a fun Disney movie this isn't it.,negative
How is this movie being praised? They'll try to get your kids any way they can these days. Disney just keeps getting worse.they make parents out to be terrible. Encourage sneaking out and lying. Basically wanting to cut off any connection between kids and their parents.,negative
"This movie has a few funny moments and I wanted to like this movie BUT .... It's not for children. This movie literally glorifies disobeying your parents so you can be your true self. Worst family values I've seen in a kids movie. There's also weird out of place comments that shouldn't be in a kids movie. Like the main characters 'sexy drawings' she does in her notebook. If you have young kids, skip this Disney movie for sure.",negative
"Two minutes into the movie & i hated the lead girl & her friends already. They are the definition of typical 13-year old brats who think it is somehow cool to disobey your parents cos' they think they are ""brainwashed"" by the society.What was the message here exactly?? To show the parents or family in a bad light who care the most about you?! Or to fantasize about boys being mermaids?! Or is it to use your powers to make some money for a concert?! I don't know & i surely don't think that it is to embrace who you truly are! And why do this woke Disney thinks that every 13 year old girl acts & thinks like that?! I have a 13 year old sister & thank god she do not acts like any of those brats & guess what she DID NOT liked the movie either.Tell me Disney if I agree with her mom (for the most part until they intentionally tried to show that she's a big evil monster!) does that make me look bad or am I not included in your woke people's list? Lmao.. Never felt more annoyed after watching a kids movie. Just wake up ""woke"" disney & stop brainwashing kids by making them watch your woke trash.Note to myself: Be aware at what your kid watches in the name of animation from now on.Easily skippable (as it also does not have a proper plot & is predictable too). DO NOT recommended watching, especially with your kids.Rating - 1/10.",negative
"If you copy Teen Wolf, 1985 starring Michael J. Fox and paste it into Pixar in 21st century, you get Turning Red. This animation signifies that Pixar is no longer a creative powerhouse.",negative
"This film is just strange from the off! Who is it aimed at? There are themes and plot lines which are meant for much older children/teens. The section which references her first period is just so strange! When you think of Pixar, you don't imagine a young girl fantasizing about boy bands with an overbearing mother who wants to help with period problems!! Weird!!",negative
There were a few laughs but I honestly found it to be bleh and cringey. Pixar has dropped the ball and the my body my choice reference is shameful for a child's movie.,negative
"I came in with low expectations after seeing the obnoxious trailers. The movie itself was even worse than the trailers made it look. There was nothing wholesome, just a fast paced collage of try-hard humor that over did it to the point that nothing was funny. The soundtrack was awful as well. Obnoxious is the best one word description. I couldn't even finish and I wish I could get the time I wasted back.",negative
"Expectations are high when a new Pixar movie is released... and this fails to get snywhere near them. The level of craft, care and attention to detail just isn't there. The story, script and characters are heavy handed, cliched and trite - trying too hard to be meaningful and failing miserably. Most disappointing though was the animation. The modelling and movement of the characters was basic at best and the style elements were weak. As a movie, especially a Pixar one, it's just not up to standard and I'm wondering if straight to Disney+ is the new straight to DVD.",negative
The victory of banal pop teen culture over the wisdom of traditional Asian culture. It's the tired Disney formula of a child finding enlightenment through rebellion which ends up somehow bringing the protagonist closer to her family in the end. The animation is beautiful as always. Story sucks. Get some imagination Disney! It's supposed to be what you're good at...,negative
"Main character is rewarded for being totally disrespectful and selfish, lying, sneaking, and disobeying. I suppose the writers and Disney/Pixar were cool with that though, because she's living ""her truth"".Terrible movie. Completely inappropriate for kids under 13.",negative
"This movie should have a warning and age restriction it is inappropriate and uncomfortable to watch. An extremely annoying teen that gets her period, loves her friends more than her parents and draws inappropriate pictures in her journal under her bed and is boy crazy! When the teen becomes a panda (metaphor for period) she turns angry and needs to be controlled... so they are saying women are crazy and super emotional when red. The elder women teach her about how to control the ""Red Panda"" at the end realizing that all her ancestors of the past had this same experience but one day the panda goes away, the mom walks inside a hole that basically says goodbye to her menstruation forever. OMG such a terrible movie that I wouldn't recommend... NOT 4 KIDS!",negative
"What the hell was this trash? 2nd movie in my 38 years of life that I couldn't bring myself to finish... a little more than half through and had to cut my losses. Horrible voice acting, poor sense of humor, not age appropriate at times, storyline completely blows. Both my kids lost interest. Go woke go broke. Disney is pushing their luck.",negative
"If someone falls in the selected audience they might enjoy this. The problem is I don't know what audience that is. It wasn't me. The animation is good but the style is a bit off, the characters are annoying, and the extra flares to some of the scenes are weird.",negative
I usually watch animated movies before showing them to my kids. I skipped the vetting because Disney/Pixar. That was a mistake. Next thing I know I'm forced to have a strange forced period talk with my eight year old daughter. It was not the time or the place for that conversation. Sex education is crucial but I don't want it forced into cartoons meant for small kids. Let parents parent. Let kids be kids.,negative
"Was looking forward to watching this with my 5 year old since it was a Pixar movie. 15 minutes in they're drooling over boys and calling boys sexy. The main characters mother finds some drawings that her daughter drew of a boy and called them ""sexy pictures"" and ""did this boy do that to you?!"" Really Pixar? Slap a PG13 on the rating so we don't show our little kids this movie. Smh.",negative
"I love Pixar. But I hated this movie. First of all, there is some not so subtle references to a young girl starting her period, talking about cramps and pads. I would HATE to have to answer all the questions from my young boys about what in the world the mother is talking about. I would also hate to tell my daughter about this life fact because it was introduced to her, too young, in this movie.Also, and more importantly, Mei-Mei is a horrible example. Encouraging kids to disobey and lie to parents because they won't understand them. Encouraging kids to do this is dangerous, and that is not an exaggeration.I don't have the desire to continue on how much I hated this. The movie was trash. Will never let my kids watch this.",negative
"I love cartoons and animated films. The movie's description led me to believe it was going to be an interesting movie, but I found the characters to be quite obnoxious. Some of the scenes they show is not something I would recommend for young kids.I'm disappointed with this generation and what kids are being shown. Pixar has many good movies, but this one isn't it. The fact that this movie has gained popularity makes me even more worried. Kids and teens deserve movies that are creative, inspiring, and fun.",negative
Pixar what the heck have you done....this movie should be shown in a health class in like 6th grade what the heck is this...there is nothing redeemable about this movie it's hard to understand the message is it puberty is it terrible relationships with parents idk what the heck it is all I know is it touches on periods...such a strange concept.,negative
The obnoxious way over the top antics of the girls was just sooooo bad. The movie lost me immediately and that's very rare for me. No subtle introductions just in your face attitude and ridiculous antics. Pixar can do so much better. I guess there's a reason this was released straight to streaming because it would be a box office BOMB.,negative
"The panda is cute, the story aint.Storywise it's like michael j fox teen wolf, also this animation is more chic movie telling bout teenage girl growing up etc.So kids probably can't relate much, the one they like in the movie is panda and cute kittens, that's it.It just fell flat & forgettable.",negative
This movie looked like a good time and a fun family movie. Instead this is a SNOOZE to sit through this movie is boring with an hour and 47 minute runtime the pacing is TERRIBLE.... not even 30 minutes in I was checking my watch waiting for the movie to be OVER. There is 1 good moment in this movie but not enough to waste almost 2 hours worth of your time.,negative
"It's pixar trying to cross a bit with Wo-eke Anime, it's pitiful that pixar churns out what suits to a minority. Think where they started and the classics they have produced then watch this, watch it back to back with a Wall-e or a toy story (even 4)and then if you've already rated it you'll drop it by at least half.",negative
"Fallen from creating aspirational and dynamic stories. And displaying behavior that I wish my children to emulate, to a little girl wanting to shake her thang.Annoying voices, bad example behavior for children and to top it off, dialog that reads like the side of a cereal box.It is a shame that with all the resources available to Pixar, this annoying, trite, shallow garbage is what they churn out. In some ways that says more about the movie-going public than the studio.As a side note, this movie is targeted at children, but a child going through puberty is distinctly not a theme for children under the age of puberty.",negative
"Where to start? How did this concept get through. I have a feeling there a million other film ideas that could've made Pixar noticeable again.It's been sooo many years since an original thought has come through the place. And I think I know why. John Lasseter left and anything and everything is getting approved as long as it fits Disney's politics.This movie is ridiculous. Old animation in my opinion. I really haven't seen anything capturing since...oh it has been awhile.Turns into a Red Panda when she's emotional...wow what a concept.No wonder this came out on Disney + and not in theaters. It's terrible.Give the next film graduate $3 million and I can bet you 100% they'd turn out something far better than this junk.Pixar used to be the best in the industry! The absolute best! Now we get this. And all ""critics"" are raving about it because if you don't you might get canceled. No sorry. A movie that is terrible needs to realize it's terrible. Perhaps so they won't make the same mistake again.Original concepts. New animation. Creativity. Thats what we'll pay to watch. Not this second draft of an idea.Sorry. Not Oscar worthy and certainly not Pixar worthy. John Lasseter would've never let this happen.",negative

"Okay, hear me out. I've NEVER had to screen Pixar movies before because we'll they're Pixar movies of course. My 7 year old was SO excited to watch this movie today after school. Me, being the mother I am and trusting Pixar, let my daughter start the movie while I was cooking.Much to my surprise when I walked out I saw scenes where the daughter was hiding under her bed, sweating and drawing ""sexy"" photos of her and a boy. It was soooooo uncomfortable. I decided to fast forward a bit and give it a chance. Even after that there were many, many things that were obviously meant for kids age 13 and older.Unfortunately it left my 7 year old with a slew of questions I was NOT ready to answer and topics I didn't want to bring up till a later age.It's weird being in a position now where I feel like I need to screen a movie geared towards little kids, and Pixar at that, before I let my kid watch it. Not because I won't let her see it (I know she's gonna hear and see worse at school) but because I feel I will need to preface the movie with a conversation on certain topics.Weird.",negative
I just watched this with three daughters aged 14-6 and we all hated it. What the hell was hell was this?? I've never ever hated a Disney movie and I can truly say I HATED this movie!!!

I wouldn't want my son or daughter to behave that way or be influenced by this movie. My kids love red pandas so I thought I would check this movie out with them. Turned it off and told my kids this wasn't a good movie for them to watch.

Tries very hard to virtue signal and is layerd with political messaging that you pick up on throughout. Has a girls only vibe rather than unity and clearly makes an effort for a girls only audience .

It has a couple cute moments, but it mainly consisted of kids being obnoxious and selfish...along with telling multiple boldface lies to parents, very inappropriate twerking (doesn't matter if it's in panda form...it's still inappropriate for young kids), and the main character is very disrespectful to her mother towards the end of the movie. And this is my personal opinion, but talk of a girl getting her period for the first time and mom flinging maxi pads around in several scenes just doesn't work for me...there is a place for it, but not on Disney+ where it raises questions from kids that parents might not feel they need to be asking yet...all in all, it's just a major letdown. There are better and more positive ways to show coming of age. Disney can do better.",negative

"It's Jerry Seinfeld for crying out loud, he only does gold! You've seen the commercials, trailers and advertisements: ""Bee Movie is a hit"". Come on, what did you expect? Hopefully nothing less than, ""yeah it was pretty funny"". That's what all these animated movies are like. How can you judge one above the other? There have been so many to this point, it's like they're all the same.Bee Movie is a cute little movie about the life of working bees that come across a corporation selling their honey. Jerry Seinfeld's character Barry decides to talk to the humans, and once he discovers the ""stealing"" of the honey, he starts a lawsuit against the humans... this can only be animated. Come on! It's cute!! Although this movie shares similar qualities with other animation films, I did notice one thing that most animated films don't have: adult humor. Yes, it's true; it's rated PG for a reason. This film is the best of both worlds because it has both the funny little immature things that kids crave, but also humorous one-liners that adults will appreciate. I loved that about this movie, it was actually very funny.6 out of 10 for my taste. Yes, it's the same movie as every other animated movie. It's only goal is to make money, and it WILL be successful. However, the plot was satisfactory, characters were very submissive and once again, Jerry's one-liners killed. Try to take notice of the little things. For only being 90 minutes, this movie is worth your time if you want a few good laughs. I hope you all enjoy.",neutral
"""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"" were both about individuality, then ""Bee Movie"" comes along to add to that same narrative. I'm just waiting for the termites and wasps to come out with their movie about breaking away from the hive/colony.In ""Bee Movie"" Barry (Jerry Seinfeld) doesn't want to do the job he's been assigned to do. What's more, he is repulsed by the idea that humans collect all the sweet honey bees make. Barry wants to do his own thing and he wants all bees of the world to be free to not have to make honey. To achieve that Barry takes the honey manufacturing companies to court.The biggest difference between this insect movie and the two aforementioned is that these insects are even more anthropomorphic. The bees speak English, can argue in court, and Barry even has a crush on a human.This movie had its moments. It was funny at times even when it was being absurd. Even with suspended disbelief, though, some of the scenes were too much. It had an individualism theme with a touch of misanthropy-- ""I want to be me and mingle with a person, but most people are bad (or at least the ones who farm bees for honey)."" If only we could talk to bees and get their approval to eat their honey then the world would be a better place.",neutral
"Let's see, we have A Bug's Life, then Antz, then the insect animated films gave way to a host of animal talkies, including dancing penguins, cows with confused genetic makeup, and zoo animals thinking they're better off in the wild, chef rats, amongst an array of hits and misses, recycling the same old tactics and game plan to snare the movie going audience.Wise-cracking animals, check. Pop culture references, check. CG animation that resembles the real world, check. Celebrity voices, let's see, we have Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Larry King, Ray Liotta, Sting, Barry Levinson, Kathy Bates, and even Oprah Winfrey. But we all know by now that you can throw in the craziest antics, stuff the movie with recognizable voices, but Pixar has taught the lesson that it always boils down to the strength of the story. And this is what Bee Movie is severely lacking.Not that it didn't try, but it went tangential to what it probably had intended, and it spawned into a big bag unmanageable hydra. Jerry Seinfeld is Barry Benson, a bee who refuses to conform to the laws of nature to having become stuck in a one-role job for the rest of his life. Before committing himself to menial tasks in the honey making process, he decides to venture out with the cool pollen collectors and see the outside world. And in the process, comes into direct contact with Vanessa Bloome the florist (voiced by Zellweger). Oh, did I also mention that bees speak English? It's just that they adhere to Commandment Number One that they shut their traps so that we won't know they understand us. Yeah right.So if you'd believe that, you'd believe anything that the movie throws at you. It becomes a courtroom drama with the usual lawyer jokes thrown in. It becomes an anti-worker exploitation movie, to stand up for the little ones, with reminders that small things matter in the whole scheme of things. It becomes a documentary on the laws of nature and the environmental / ecological equilibrium that has to be maintained. And the ultimate out of place scene involves a bloody jumbo jet in the sky in homage to the Airplane spoofs. Yes, while I know Bee Movie pays its homage to B-movies, you'd probably still wonder what the scriptwriters had in the coffee.But given its multiple personality and indecision to focus on something that it can chew, the graphics here are still no less than stunning. The bees in flight, with the mashing of the black and yellow, is pure poetry in motion, blending well with various backgrounds, be it the city skyline, or the green lungs with colourful flowers dotting the landscape. It's extremely fluid with attention paid to the details, and would be worth every penny should there be an IMAX version of this portion of the movie. Such scenes warrant the price of an admission ticket, but alas, more could have probably been done to save the movie.Bee Movie is again targeted at kids, although chances are they'll miss the many adult jokes and references so come fast and furious (some of which just fall flat unfortunately). And having a lack of ""cute"" characters, might dent its appeal, and narrow merchandising opportunities. Better luck next time Jerry!",neutral
"Things this completely not sarcastically educational movie learned me: 1. Bees are so helpful they even build the title of the movie on a road, so a car is most likely gonna crash into it. 2. Bees have glasses and shoes. Where do they get glass and leather when apparently everybody works at Honex? 3. They have to watch birds and bats and bears, but they can't just communicate with the other animals. 4. They fly above a pond, but a fish doesn't eat them. And even if they could communicate with the fish, fishes are stupid as mud. 5. They fly by a bunch of kites, but they fly ABOVE THE BUILDINGS. They must have a LONG piece of rope. 6. Apparently bees are super intelligent, but why don't make a movie about monkeys or dolphins, species that actually ARE intelligent. 7. Bees are racist against other insects, because Barry reveals that he has a girlfriend to which his mother says ""I just hope she's a bee"". 8. Bees have houses inside their hive, but isn't the hive supposed to be their house? 9. Barry doesn't realize that stopping with making honey is gonna kill all plants. 10. Apparently trees will die to without bees",neutral
"Despite this movie basically being one giant pun it had a very good message, but similar to Wall-E and Happy Feet the message will be ignored due to the fact that humans are just too heartless to care. I'm also confident that this could have been done way better. The writing wasn't terrible but overall felt like they didn't look over it enough times because the movie felt like the equivalent of a lecture telling you about something you either already know or something so obvious you should already know it, but presented in a way to try making it more enjoyable. Visually there wasn't much to say. The colours used felt pretty standard but did work perfectly with what they were going for. Honestly this movie could have been wonderful, all it really needs is to be rewritten without taking away the message and a new cast that actually fits the movie. One thing I always think about with any family animation is the re-watch factor. Since children tend to want what they like on repeat a lot of movies tend to get re-watched day after day, and a movies ability to stay entertaining and enjoyable for an older audience in that environment is important to me. Lately a lot of movies I've reviews have had a good re-watch factor but I struggle to really see one in this. Also I do like the re-use of the bear model that was used for ""Vincent"", the bear from Over The Hedge.",neutral
"I just want to give a shout out to all insect lovers that I HATE bees! They buzz all day and sting where if you don't pay attention to the types of bees, you can die! In 1998 we had two movies involving the lives of insects with Antz (The Woody Allen cartoon) depicting the lives of none other than ants while Disney's A Bug's Life showed all the insects living in a world.Now in Bee Movie, audiences get to see the funnier side of bees along with a strange story line of how bees get their honey. Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) lives in a beehive where its paradise from a home to a swimming pool of honey to hanging out with his buddy Adam (Matthew Broderick) in a colony where they work together until after graduation when both bees see that they have to work in the same place for the rest of their life as Barry wants to explore the world of humans. Barry meets a human woman name Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) who runs a flower shop where both the human and insect start talking. It may be animation and all rules can bend, but in the real world no insects can talk to a human after they sting them. The subplot in the movie involves Barry wanting to fight off the humans after seeing that the honey they use to live is being marketed for profit without the bees getting anything.""Bee Movie"" has it's hits and misses, but mainly misses where it feels like a movie for Jerry Seinfeld fans to a point where its like watching a animated rerun of Seinfeld in which you have to watch the show and live in Jerry's world to get the jokes.",neutral
"Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):The idea of anthropomorphism is certainly nothing new in animated cinema, but in Bee Movie, written by comedy giant Jerry Seinfeld, one is driven to ask آ– is this one step too far? Bee Movie is essentially an allegory of human existence. Our protagonist, Barry Benson (Jerry Seinfeld), a bee, has recently graduated and become disenfranchised with the idea of making honey for the rest of his life. Through a series of events, Benson comes to learn that humans eat honey, and as such, endeavours to sue the human race. How such subject matter meanders into a children's film is a curiosity, and I find myself thinking that adults may better identify with the film's themes than the ankle-biting target audience.Bee Movie also employs a rather strange means of character modelling آ– the bee characters resemble human beings more than in any other film such as this, with even their skin tones closely resembling the white cross-section of society. When you combine this with the fact that the bees drive cars to work, it would at times become easy to forget that this is even a film about insects.As questionable as the film's content can be, the visual effects are undeniably impressive, although will be starkly overshadowed by the visual feast that is Beowulf. There are numerous scenes of distinct chaos, all of which are appropriately bombastic and colourful, and as such are easy to simply sit back and absorb.Whilst one doesn't expect moral complexity from a film such as this, the characters are incredibly black and white آ– the human who interacts with Benson, Vanessa (Renأ©e Zellweger), is an exponent of animal rights, rather preposterously attesting that the life of a bee is as important as that of a human. Meanwhile, her boyfriend, Ken (voiced by Family Guy's excellent Patrick Warburton) is very much the opposite, and quite rightly, I found myself agreeing with his sentiments.Some of the inherent mechanics of Bee Movie's premise are materially strange آ– the fact that a bee alone can talk to a human is preposterous enough, but the fact that she can hear the minute sound that a bee is able to project is insane. Still, I see this not as an overt complaint آ– as a mechanic it is slightly clumsy and awkward-looking, but one soon gets used to it, and for whom this film ultimately concerns, they're unlikely to be bothered by it. However, there is one sigh-inducing instance, in which Benson is able to overpower a human in a mock ""sword fight"" آ– whilst I don't necessarily expect a scientifically plausible film, this came close to destroying the barrier entirely. That said, without most of these divergences, we wouldn't have much of a film, would we now? As strange a choice as the premise is for a children's film, there are also a number of adult jibes that will undoubtedly zoom far over the heads of the target audience. There was a rather surprising blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to sexually transmitted diseases (which left me unsure whether to laugh or fold my arms), and numerous cinematic references in Ray Liotta's brief appearance.The real gems of Bee Movie are the numerous cameo appearances, including Chris Rock (as a blood-hungry mosquito), John Goodman (a slimy, morbidly obese and melodramatic lawyer), as well as the aforementioned Ray Liotta, and Sting as themselves. There's even a bee version of Larry King, inventively named ""Bee Larry King"", an overly anthropomorphic character (in that he almost entirely resembles King to a tee), but Seinfeld makes light of this fact and its deliberation, so it hardly irritates.The idea of a bee taking legal action against the human race is about as preposterous a premise as one could excavate, and I largely expect that had Jerry Seinfeld or a similarly talented individual not appeared at the helm, then this project would have been thrown headlong into development Hell, or been given the red light from the outset. More to the point, the film's finale barely befits the tone of the proceeding hour, with a high-octane finale placing human lives at stake. Naturally, we know that there's never any real danger, and nobody will die in this film, yet it still feels like a cheesy, inane throwback to films such as Turbulence or about fifty direct-to-video action films, and worse still, the laws of physics are torn up, shredded, and shredded once more.As one can expect, everything returns to the status quo, the equilibrium is re-introduced, everyone gets their just desserts and the credits roll rather swiftly. Bee Movie is a feel good film by its end, but there's a decent amount of adult content so very tactfully slotted in between the bright colours and pretty rendered faces. Given the film's tone at times, with jokes about suicide pacts, I was half expecting the film to end with our sympathetic human protagonist turning out to be insane, having invented her conversations with the bee in her head, but alas, it wasn't so, which is a shame, as it would have made for a considerably more entertaining film.Bee Movie is one of the more intriguing animated films to surface in a long time آ– it's not that the film is outstanding in any aspect, but Seinfeld's brand of humour transposed onto and disguised as a children's film is either quite disconcerting, or incredibly smart on his part. The film is full of awkward action scenes, but each instance it falls down, it still manages to dazzle with slick, frenetic animation. Zellweger is appropriately irritating as the overexcited human protagonist, and the supporting cast, cameos and all, form most of what is enjoyable about Bee Movie. Seinfeld may need to reconsider who his target audience is, but this is an interesting and daring attempt at something a little different in the animated world.",neutral
"With such great actors in the cast, you might have thought Bee Movie would be so much different from other animation movies. Instead, the same old story - a single bee from the beechive has the revelation of their well planed but still boring life, so it tries to have a different one. It goes in the city, talks to a young woman, and eventually it even sues humanity for stealing their honey. If Antz or A Bug's Life are about animal societies without changing much of the way the little bugs really live, Bee Movie presents bees driving cars, bees able to talk to humans. You might find it funny, take your children with you if you want to go see it.",neutral
"Bee Movie - A Histأ³ria de uma Abelha (Brazil) / A Histأ³ria de uma Abelha (Portugal) is an American animated film released in 2007 and directed by Steve Hickner and Simon J. Scomum.The film tells the story of Barry B. Benson, a college graduate bee who was deluded into the prospect of having only one career choice: making honey. One day, Barry manages to leave the hive where bees lived in Central Park and his life is saved by a woman, Vanessa, a good-hearted florist from New York City. As their relationship flourishes, Barry becomes aware of the human world and soon finds that people consume the honey that bees struggle to make. Armed with this information, Barry realizes his true calling and decides to sue the human race for stealing honey from bees. As a result, men and bees become related differently, accusing each other, Barry finds himself in the middle of the confusion and will have to solve some very unusual problems.This movie was released when I was 13 years old marked my child already reviewed so many times and today decided to see again to kill the nostalgia!Barry is a bee who did not want to work like other bees and wanted so much to get out of the hive into the world, he knows a florist named Vanessa and as time went on he knew it wasn't exactly what he expected from humans! It was learning what in his idea was harmful. So my movie score is 6.0 out of 6.0.",neutral

"Bee Movie has that typical set up that we've see in many other computer animated films of recent years. A small hero (usually male) inhabits a world in which all is perfect in its systematic working and setting; a resemblance of a world in which everything within the boundaries of home is 'good' and works to an efficient degree whereas most things outside of it are strange, unknown and to be left alone. Monster's Inc. had its factory fuelled by 'screams'; Finding Nemo had its patch at the bottom of the sea of which Nemo's father inhabited with Nemo following a prior tragedy involving family death and now Bee Movie has its hive in which pollen is brought in and honey is produced through an array of different machines and methods.The film is a strange beast, combining those enjoyable and surreal aspects CGI animated films brings to the genre of animation revolving around fish or monsters or toys living side by side with humans in the real world. It's fun to think monsters use kid's closets to capture screaming so that they can survive and it's equally fun to assume bees are producing masses of honey under factory like conditions with advanced machinery. But Bee Movie's audaciousness is its own downfall; blurring the boundaries between what's real; surreal; fun and just plain stupid. Eventuallu, the film will have the species that is 'the bee' take human beings to court in a gross misjudgement of narrative as well as humanise one of its characters enough to kick up a potential love story.The film begins with that usually enjoyable and comic point of attack films like Monster's Inc. and Finding Nemo et al present. Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) is a bee living in the hive complete with family and friends. He graduates and his career decision is left up to a lottery of sorts in which he has to decide over an ever changing timetable what his job will be for life آ– there is no going back. If Bee Movie were not a fun, family friendly Dreamworks production then it might well be a horror film about insects that have become too self aware of what's going on outside of their realm آ– think 1954's 'Them!' but with bees and more of a grudge.So this point of attack that usually consists of jokes and visual gags to do with the universe these creatures (fish, closet monsters, bees) inhabit actually works quite well in Bee Movie. Bees have invented television and can predict the weather, if you can get your head around that, and have a perfectly planned out system of producing and texturing honey. Then the character ventures outside of its realm, similarly to Nemo being fish-knapped or the human venturing into the monster's world and threatening to undo all the good that is the safe haven. Here, Barry ventures out after a lacklustre and rather obvious motivation to do with a confrontation with pollen collectors. The pollen collectors are physically bigger than everyone else and have big booming voices; they are the military of the establishment, the brave few who risk life and wing in the real world of which it is vastly unsafe compared to life in the hive.The film sees Barry leave the hive in an attempt to prove himself but the film does not go down that route of self discovery, nor does it seem too bothered about failing to set up a clear cut goal such as finding nemo the fish or getting rid of the kid human. Instead, Barry ends up meeting Vanessa Bloome (Zellweger) and begins to love her. It's here that the wheels threaten to fall off because while I'm fine with inter-species fondness in animated films; since the child human and John Goodman's monster in Monster's Inc. took on father/daughter ideas, here in Bee Movie it just doesn't quite work.But this is before the discovery that honey is being sold in supermarkets and this is where the bolts on the wheel twitch a little. The courtroom scenes basically pit ""us versus them"" as one of Barry's friends put it earlier on; humans vs. bees and I know whose side I'm on. But it's not the alienation the audience will get with the film's protagonist that's the problem here, it's the daft cameos from Sting and Ray Liotta who I'm sure were paid lashings of money just to be mocked. It's also the bumbling and physically tumbling character of lawyer Layton T. Montgomery (Goodman) whose rear end fills the screen in a pathetic attempt to evoke some sort of laugh from the kids watching on. The scene is also a disappointing set up for Barry's friend Adam (Broderick) to try and resist stinging him; something that will pump the story into its final third and give its hero Barry a further drive for success.So following all that's said and done, Bee Movie transgresses into a chase movie of sorts right towards the end. The outcome of the court case sees the hive stop production and descend into farce, perhaps a message along the lines of: without strict law, order and routine in a ruling utopia there can only ever be chaos. The mock political imagery of a Saddam Hussein statue being pulled down and the bees resembling F-16 fighter jets as they aid a jumbo jet airliner in distress is a little clumsy in the sense it is content the makers are consciously including for means of entertainment. Bee Movie may end badly and get progressively clumsier in the middle but it ends when it should, not outstaying its welcome, and acts as an average animated film that may well evoke a few chuckles anyway.",neutral
"Bee Movie tell us the story of an young bee who stands in front of the crossroad of his life when he graduates and has to choose his career. To make his decision, he flies outside, sees the world, meets human, has accidents and eventually decides to sue human for using bee honey illegally. The story is good, enriched by some humour & intelligent dialogues. The visual meets current standard of digital movie, with some gorgeous scenes. The audio is also nice although the voice cast should be better. It seems there is a lot of positive aspects, but the movie itself as a whole leaves me no impression. It's predictable and routine. It is nice, but far from great. I can only recommend Bee movie for some free time when there is no other animation to watch. If you try to watch the movie for the second time, you'll find yourself pushing ""fast forward"" more often than you usually do, not because it's a bad movie, but because we can hardly find something in the movie that can stay in our memory for long.Bee Movie is a well-made animation, but sadly, a passable one.",neutral
"My expectations weren't very high for Bee Movie, but it somehow fulfilled what little hope I had that the star power would come through. Unlike Sharktale, where an equally admirable couple of talents combined voice-work (Scorsese and De Niro), Jerry Seinfeld, who co-wrote and co-produced the picture as well, has the right kind of attitude to change up the typical animated movie while not ever reinventing it. It's a tricky enterprise to recommend, because for kids it might have some wit to it that they might not really get, despite the color palette being almost as fresh as Pixar's Cars, and for adults there isn't the plethora of instantly quotable lines and unforgettable innuendo and eccentricities from the great 'show about nothing'. But considering that it's coming from a man who's never done a starring role in a movie, let alone an animated one, or that it's his first time attempting to write one, it's successful in a sense.That sense, really, is that a sort of sensibility from his stand-up comedy has carried over. All the little observations on the topic of bees and honey and what have you are covered, head to stinger, and a lot of the best moments are when the actors feel like they're riffing like on a stand-up stage. Although the actual storyline itself is kind of clunky and a little like a so-so children's book (save for the elements of the lawsuit and its outcome, which if one pay's attention to the news lately has even environmental relevance with bees and their connection to pollination), the filmmakers are able to straddle the line to make it worthwhile as a 'family' film, with equal bits of fun for young and old. Old, in the sense that the jokes about Ray Liotta, Sting, southern lawyers named ""Ali-Buy"", possible ethnically stereotyped bees (Barry's family, wee bit like his folks on Seinfeld), will get them more than the kiddies. Even when interest in the actual outcome of the situation grows a little weary, and a climax at an airport and up in the air doesn't completely work, little things just stick out very well.It's a vibrant, fast-paced CGI-feature, lacking the power and gravitas of a PIXAR film, but at the same time not stooping to the sophomoric levels that many another CGI movie (including the Shrek films) go for. Not exactly a very good movie, but very far from a bad one: it's like a Jerry Seinfeld concert special about bees, nothing but, and somehow, however unlikely, with a fairly charming performance as an actor- as opposed to the sitcom, where he was, more or less, playing himself in an equally crazy world. Other cool voice-work, by the way, from Patrick Warburton, Chris Rock, John Goodman, and Michael Richards.",neutral

"If you start looking at it on a critical level you'll start to hate it. Is it riddled with major plot holes, yes but is it light hearted and fun for the family, also yes.",neutral
"Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) is a bee who just graduated from college. He is dismayed that he has to pick one job for the rest of his life without a day off. Instead of working in the hive, he joins the pollen jockeys who fly outside. Talking to humans is strictly forbidden but that's exactly what Barry does when florist Vanessa Bloome (Renأ©e Zellweger) saves his life. He can't settle on a job for 3 whole days. He is shocked to find that humans are stealing honey from bees. So he decides to sue the human race. Then nature is destroyed in an apocalypse. How fun!Jerry Seinfeld is being Jerry Seinfeld except he's a bee. Talking to humans diminishes the magic of the bee world. It's not that the bee world is that magical or fascinating. It's bright and yellow. But it's very workaday. The marrying of bee world with references to the real world is cute for a little while but it gets tiresome. Then the whole trial thing gets to be just stupid and not actually funny. It's an OK movie that is essentially a 90 minute take of a Seinfeld standup of what if he's a bee.",neutral
"I distinctly remember my negative reaction to the trailers. This was never something I was that interested in watching, however, a friend of mine lent it to me, so I gave it a shot. I usually don't go for fully-animated films, especially these 3D ones, and this helps confirm my reasoning for that stance; too much focus is put upon the visuals, and the audience does so much ""ooh"" and ""ahh""-ing that they forget the actual quality. Now, it's been a while since I last watched his show, though I don't recall Seinfeld(also, about him, he should not yell again... or talk in a ""ghetto"" fashion... or make another full-length movie, at least without practice or something) spelling out his punchlines like this, nor using so many cringe-inducing, physically painful puns. I can't see anyone other than children laughing at this, and that does not have to be true for a family flick. You'd be hard pressed to find more than a handful of actually good jokes in this. That's a big failure for a comedy, and if the plot was compelling and the moral excellent. I wish I could claim that it was so, in either case. The story is weird, and the concept continually contradicts itself, and simply does not hold up. Also, this seems like it's speaking to those who feel like their job is small, repetitive and meaningless, and merely trying to keep them docile? And for that, they screw around with how nature actually works? For *this*? Design is OK, very bright, cheery and colorful. The acting is intentionally overdone. There is little that censors would find offensive in this. The DVD holds featurettes, a reasonably entertaining and informative commentary track with Jerry and crew, a Dreamworks video jukebox, trailers and a music video. I recommend this to those into these kind of pictures. 6/10",neutral
"Barry B. Benson, a bee who has just graduated from college, is disillusioned at his lone career choice: making honey. On a special trip outside the hive, Barry's life is saved by Vanessa, a florist in New York City. As their relationship blossoms, he discovers humans actually eat honey, and subsequently decides to sue us.There's a certain aspect about this film that would make people happy: It's the lively colors with popping eye candy throughout the film! There's even this 5 minutes action sequence where we see the point of view of the bees and the large world around them! Well, it's done before in many other animated movies but none like this.However, the plot is a bit, well, ridiculous and it's not just one of those plots we can ""go along for the ride."" In the one hour mark, the movie has a different tone and view and I like the idea because it raises questions what we are doing to the bees because it's actually happening in our world right now.What I like in this movie are some risky and sometimes flat out hilarious jokes. I'm sure this movie would fair better with the kids than the adults. I found it tolerable and it's a decent film with some funny jokes but the story is just outlandish and awkward, but who knows, it's an animated movie, right?",neutral
